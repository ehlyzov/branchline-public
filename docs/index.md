# Branchline DSL Documentation

Branchline is a Kotlin-based DSL for transforming structured data. These docs cover language features, guides, and an interactive playground. For a formal reference, see the [language grammar](language/grammar.md).

## Introduction

Branchline's goal is to provide a compact language for describing data
transformations. It is designed for clarity and composability when working with
structured information. The roadmap focuses on richer collection operations,
expanded standard libraries, and tooling that makes the DSL easier to adopt.
