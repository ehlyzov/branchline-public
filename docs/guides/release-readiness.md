# Release Readiness & Stability

How we define stability and readiness for Branchline releases.

## Stability levels
- **Experimental:** subject to change without notice.
- **Stable:** compatible within a major version.

## Readiness checklist
- Documentation updated.
- Conformance tests pass.
- Benchmarks reviewed.

## Compatibility expectations
- Breaking changes require a major version bump.
- Non-breaking changes can ship in minor releases.
