# Migration Guides

Migration guides describe breaking changes once versions are published. Until then, this page lists the expected workflow.

## Planned workflow
1. Each release gets a migration guide if behavior changes.
2. Breaking changes include a summary, rationale, and step-by-step fixes.
3. Compatible changes are documented in release notes only.
