Use the embedded editor below to experiment with Branchline code directly in the browser. The playground boots the interpreter compiled to JavaScript and runs your program against the JSON object bound to `row`.

- Press **Run** or use **âŒ˜/Ctrl + Enter** to execute the current transform.
- The default snippet demonstrates projecting customer data from the input payload.
- Any parse or semantic errors are surfaced inline with their location.
