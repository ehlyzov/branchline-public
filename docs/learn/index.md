# Tour of Branchline

A short, example-driven path for workflow and ETL builders. Each chapter is quick to read and links to a runnable Playground example.

## How to use this tour
- Read in order if you are new to Branchline.
- Jump to a chapter if you want a specific pattern.
- Run every example in the Playground to build intuition.

## Chapters
1. [Hello, Transform](hello-transform.md): write your first transform.
2. [Paths and Reshaping](paths-and-reshaping.md): navigate input data and build output objects.
3. [Control Flow for Pipelines](control-flow.md): filter, map, and branch on conditions.
4. [Error Handling and Tracing](error-handling.md): keep pipelines safe and observable.
5. [Real-world Recipes](recipes.md): ETL scenarios you can adapt.

## What you will build
- Customer and order payload enrichment.
- Health-gated pipelines with trace output.
- Test report summaries suitable for dashboards.

If you prefer the reference first, head to the [Language Overview](../language/index.md) or the [Standard Library](../language/std-core.md).
