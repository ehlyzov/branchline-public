# Real-world Recipes

These short scenarios mirror the kinds of workflows ETL builders ship in production. Each one links to a runnable example you can adapt.

## Customer profile enrichment
Add defaults, normalize nested fields, and build a stable output schema.
- [customer-profile](../playground.md?example=customer-profile){ target="_blank" }

## Order shipment normalization
Collect shipping and line-item data into a clean shipment record.
- [order-shipment](../playground.md?example=order-shipment){ target="_blank" }

## Pipeline health gating
Fail fast when health checks or test gates break.
- [pipeline-health-gating](../playground.md?example=pipeline-health-gating){ target="_blank" }

## Test report summaries
Transform JUnit XML-like data into a compact dashboard summary.
- [junit-badge-summary](../playground.md?example=junit-badge-summary){ target="_blank" }

## Collection transforms
Batch reshape collections for downstream storage or API calls.
- [collection-transforms](../playground.md?example=collection-transforms){ target="_blank" }

## Where to go next
- Browse the [Standard Library](../language/std-core.md) for reusable helpers.
- Explore deployment tips in [Production Use](../guides/production-use.md).
