# AI Canonical Subset

Use this subset when generating Branchline from tools, agents, examples, or repair loops. It is stricter than the parser: accepted legacy syntax may still run, but AI-facing output should use one predictable style.

## Authoring workflow

Generate a program, inspect it, then run it:

```bash
bl inspect program.bl --contracts --contracts-json --normalized
```

Use the normalized source as the canonical version when it is present. If `normalizedSource` is `null`, read diagnostics and warnings first; null can mean normalization was not requested, the source used unsupported subset features, or the normalizer could not render a node safely.

## Inspect JSON envelope

`bl inspect --contracts --contracts-json` returns a stable machine envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "diagnostics": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "featureUsage": { "features": ["output", "object"] },
  "subsetCompatibility": "COMPATIBLE",
  "normalizedSource": null,
  "transforms": [
    {
      "name": "Main",
      "contractSource": "inferred",
      "explicitContract": null,
      "inferredContract": {},
      "mergedContract": {},
      "witness": null
    }
  ]
}
```

For single-transform programs, the root object also keeps the historical contract fields such as `input`, `output`, `name`, and `source` so existing contract consumers can migrate incrementally.

Envelope evolution is additive by default. Consumers should ignore unknown fields, treat enum additions as possible, and depend on `success`, `diagnostics`, `warnings`, `featureUsage`, `subsetCompatibility`, `normalizedSource`, and `transforms` as the stable root contract.

Diagnostics keep stable base fields: `code`, `message`, `severity`, `span`, `category`, and `payload`. Payload keys such as `operation`, `targetPath`, `expectedKind`, `actualKind`, `expected`, `actual`, and `hint` are optional and additive.

## Canonical constructs

| Area | Generate this |
| --- | --- |
| Input root | `input` |
| Statements | One statement per line, no trailing semicolons |
| Loops | `FOR EACH item IN items WHERE condition { ... }` |
| Direct collection shaping | Array comprehensions or collection expressions |
| Explicit accumulator append | `items += item` after `LET items = []` |
| Local replacement | `SET name = expression` |
| Path replacement | `SET object.path = expression` when parents already exist |
| Grouped object update | `MODIFY object.path { key: value }` |
| Pure list expression | `APPEND(list, value)` only when an expression value is needed |
| Output | `OUTPUT { ... }` |

## Accepted but not canonical

These forms may parse or run for compatibility, but canonical tools should not emit them:

| Accepted form | Canonical form |
| --- | --- |
| `row.name` | `input.name` |
| `LET x = 1;` | `LET x = 1` |
| `FOR item IN input.items { ... }` | `FOR EACH item IN input.items { ... }` |
| `SET items = APPEND(items, item)` | `items += item` |
| `APPEND(list, value)` for accumulation | `+=` or a collection expression |

`APPEND(list, value)` remains the canonical expression-style function when a new list value is needed inside another expression:

```branchline
LET next = APPEND(input.tags ?? [], "verified")
OUTPUT { tags: next }
```

## Unsupported in the AI subset

Do not generate orchestration or host-coupled constructs in the AI canonical subset MVP:

- `SHARED` declarations and shared writes
- `AWAIT` or shared awaits
- `SUSPEND`
- graph orchestration declarations
- hidden in-place mutation or implicit creation of missing intermediate containers

The parser may support some of these constructs for broader language use. Inspect should classify them as unsupported for AI authoring rather than treating them as canonical style.

## Mutation patterns

| Intent | Preferred pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Map/filter an input list into an output list | Use an array comprehension or collection expression |
| Append one item to an explicit local accumulator | `LET out = []` then `out += item` |
| Append into a nested local accumulator | `state.items += item` after `state.items` already exists |
| Build a new list as an expression value | `APPEND(list, value)` |
| Replace a value | `SET target = value` |

`+=` does not declare variables and does not create missing parent objects or lists. Initialize accumulators explicitly with `LET` or an object literal before updating them.
