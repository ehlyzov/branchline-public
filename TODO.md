# TODO

- Bundle Node dependencies (e.g., `fast-xml-parser`) alongside the packaged CLI so consumers do not have to run `npm install` manually.
- Track the JS runtime numeric quirks observed while porting the JUnit summary flow (documented in `research/cli.md#js-runtime-numeric-quirks-junit-summary-flow`).
