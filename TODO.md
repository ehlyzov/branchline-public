# TODO

- âœ… Resolved: top-level `FUNC` declarations in `cli/scripts/*.bl` now work after seeding function parameters into the semantic analyzer scope, allowing helpers such as `FUNC toNumber(value) { ... }` to compile without undefined identifier or parsing errors.
- Track the JS runtime numeric quirks observed while porting the JUnit summary flow:
  - `NUMBER("2")` returns a `BLBigDec`, and mixing that with plain integers in expressions (`0 + NUMBER("2")`) crashes with `ClassCastException`.
  - Emitting a raw `BLBigDec` (e.g., `OUTPUT NUMBER("2")`) is rejected (`Expected object or list of objects in OUTPUT, got BLBigDec`).
  - Replacing arithmetic with host-side parsing (Node `Number.parseInt`) is the current workaround; the CLI should probably normalise numeric conversions for mixed-precision math on the JS target.
