# Branchline

Branchline is an experimental data transformation language for building efficient pipelines in low-code environments. It focuses on converting one JSON-like document into another while offering tooling to make the process observable, predictable, and fast. Comparisons with JSONATA, JOLT, and similar technologies are planned for the future.

## Project Status

> **Alpha:** the language is evolving quickly and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed yet.

## Motivation

I created Branchline while exploring alternative ways to describe integration flows. I needed a language that:

1. Includes built-in primitives for debugging.
2. Stays approachable for non-programmers who will author transformations.
3. Is deterministic enough for AI systems to generate correct code.
4. Delivers solid performance.
5. Can be measured and optimized with clear feedback loops.
6. Works across diverse data structuresâ€”JSON, XML, CSV, and beyond.
7. Operates reliably in shared-memory, multi-threaded environments.
8. Remains open enough to satisfy my curiosity for language and platform design research.

A key goal of the project is to offload as much coding as possible to AI agents (primarily Codex with a Plus subscription). This lets me focus on language- and platform-design experiments during evenings and weekends while agents handle the bulk of implementation work. Spoiler: the results have exceeded my expectations.

## Guiding Principles

Branchline aims to provide several qualities that are often missing in industrial integration tooling:

1. **End-to-end tracing.** Every program should be able to explain how outputs were produced, exposing that trace in a machine-readable form.
2. **Multiplatform parity.** The lexer, parser, interpreter, compiler, and VM are implemented in Kotlin without external dependencies, ensuring the JVM and JS runtimes behave identically.
3. **Static contracts (in research).** With reasonable limits on expressiveness (for example, forbidding glob queries) we should infer input/output contracts, determine program compatibility ahead of time, and highlight conflicts automatically.
4. **Shared memory as a first-class concept.** The `SHARED` construct signals that a program uses shared state, enabling straightforward integrations such as database or HTTP access, or waiting for specific keys before resuming execution.
5. **Serializable execution.** Programs can suspend via `SUSPEND`, park execution until an event occurs, and even export bytecode for step-by-step evaluation in other runtimes.
6. **Efficient data handling.** The VM is designed to optimize bytecode and manipulate complex structures with minimal overhead.
7. **Straightforward transformations.** Accessing fields in incoming documents and composing outgoing payloads should be effortless.
8. **Built-in common operations.** Frequently used transformation patterns belong in the language so users do not have to reinvent them.
